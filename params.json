A new file will be created in teh same folder of the original image with _<image_name>_coords.txt_ that will contain the coordinates.\r\n\r\nThe coordinates will also be copied to the clipboard so you can paste them in your code directly.\r\n\r\nThe program will look for a coordinates file when opening an image file and load the points so you can continue your previous work.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nBugs go here: https://github.com/d0n3val/Vertex-Box2D/issues\r\n\r\nSalut!\r\nRic","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
