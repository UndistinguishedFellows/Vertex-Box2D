If you don't care for the code, _you can file a win32 executable in the Editor folder_.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nDrop any **PNG **file in the window to have the image loaded and ready for editing:\r\n\r\n- To add new points use left mouse button\r\n- Right button is used to pan around\r\n- Center wheel allows you to zoom in / out\r\n- Press **BACKSPACE **to delete the last vertex entered\r\n- While selecting a point press **DEL **to remove it\r\n\r\nTo save your work close the application or load another image. A new file will be created in teh same folder of the original image with _<image_name>_coords.txt_ that will contain the coordinates.\r\n\r\nThe coordinates will also be copied to the clipboard so you can paste them in your code directly.\r\n\r\nThe program will look for a coordinates file when opening an image file and load the points so you can continue your previous work.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nQuickly hacked by Ric <ricardo.pillosu@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nSalut!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
