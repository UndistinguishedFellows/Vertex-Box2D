# Vertex Box2D #

A simple utility to draw collision polygons for Box2D.

## Usage ##

Drop any PNG file in the window to have the image loaded and ready for editing:

- To add new points use left mouse button
- Right button is used to pan around
- Center wheel allows you to zoom in / out
- Press BACKSPACE to delete the last vertex entered
- While selecting a point press DEL to remove it

To save your work close the application or load another image. A new file will be created in teh same folder of the original image with <image_name>_coords.txt that will contain the coordinates.

The coordinates will also be copied to the clipboard so you can paste them in your code directly.

The program will look for this file when opening a file and load the points so you can continue your previous work.
